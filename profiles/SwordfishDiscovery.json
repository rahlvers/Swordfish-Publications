This may be instantiated as a CapacitySources structure to feed a StoragePool, FileSystem, or Volume.  When drives are used, the Drives Collection in either Storage or, when implementing the ClassOfService Feature, StorageServices shall be implemented. 2: When drives are used, the Drives Collection in Chassis shall be implemented.",
