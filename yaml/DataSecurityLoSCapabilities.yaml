        None: This enumeration literal specifies No authentication.
        PKI: This enumeration literal specifies a Public Key Infrastructure. Customers
          with the highest assurance requirements roll PKI out to hosts and users
          (it is more common for hosts than users. User PKI-based authentication has
          significant operational complications and administrative overheads, e.g.,
          smart cards may be involved.
        Password: 'This enumeration literal specifies Password/shared-secret: Absent
          an distributed authentication infrastructure, this is what is typically
          done.'
        Ticket: 'This enumeration literal specifies Ticket-based (e.g., Kerberos):
          This is the most common class of authentication infrastructure used in enterprises.
          Kerberos is the best known example, and Windows usage of that via Active
          Directory is so widely deployed as to be a de facto standard. In other areas
          (e.g., academia) there are comparable ticket-based systems.'
      x-longDescription: The enumeration literals shall specify authentication algorithms.

        Clear: Sanitize data in all user-addressable storage locations for protection
          against simple non-invasive data recovery techniques.
        CryptographicErase: Leverages the encryption of target data by enabling sanitization
          of the target data's encryption key. This leaves only the ciphertext remaining
          on the media, effectively sanitizing the data by preventing read-access.
          For more information, see NIST800-88 and ISO/IEC 27040.
        None: No sanitization.
      x-enumLongDescriptions:
