          description: Expected average IO latency.
          nullable: true
          readOnly: false
          type: integer
          x-longDescription: The value shall be the expected average IO latency in
            microseconds calculated over sample periods (see SamplePeriodSeconds).

          nullable: true
          readOnly: false
          type: boolean
          x-longDescription: If true, the system should not allow IOPS to exceed MaxIoOperationsPerSecondPerTerabyte
            * VolumeSize. Otherwise, the system shall not enforce a limit.  The default
            value for this property is false.

          description: A description of the expected workload.
          x-longDescription: The value shall be a description of the expected workload.
            The workload provides the context in which the values of MaxIOOperationsPerSecondPerTerabyte
            and AverageIOOperationLatencyMicroseconds are expected to be achievable.
        MaxIOOperationsPerSecondPerTerabyte:
          description: The amount of IOPS a volume of a given committed size can support.
          nullable: true
          readOnly: false
          type: integer
          x-longDescription: The value shall be the amount of IOPS a volume of a given
            committed size in Terabytes can support. This IOPS density value is useful
            as a metric that is independent of capacity. Cost is a function of this
            value and the AverageIOOperationLatencyMicroseconds.

          x-longDescription: The value shall be an ISO 8601 duration specifying the
            sampling period over which average values are calculated.

      x-longDescription: This structure may be used to define a service option related
        to IO performance.
