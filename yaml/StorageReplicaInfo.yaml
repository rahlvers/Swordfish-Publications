    StorageReplicaInfo_ReplicaFaultDomain:
      description: Values of ReplicaFaultDomain describe the fault domain for the
        replication relationship.
      enum:
      - Local
      - Remote
      type: string
      x-enumDescriptions:
        Local: Local indicates that the source and target replicas are contained within
          a single fault domain.
        Remote: Remote indicates that the source and target replicas are in separate
          fault domains.
      x-enumLongDescriptions:
        Local: This enumeration literal shall indicate that the source and target
          replicas are contained within a single fault domain.
        Remote: This enumeration literal shall indicate that the source and target
          replicas are in separate fault domains.
      x-longDescription: The enumeration literals may be used to specify the fault
        domain for the replication relationship.
    StorageReplicaInfo_ReplicaInfo:
      $ref: http://redfish.dmtf.org/schemas/swordfish/v1/StorageReplicaInfo.v1_4_0.yaml#/components/schemas/StorageReplicaInfo_v1_4_0_ReplicaInfo
      description: Defines the characteristics of a replica of a source.
      x-longDescription: The value shall define the characteristics of a replica of
        a source.
    StorageReplicaInfo_ReplicaType:
      description: Values of ReplicaType describe the intended outcome of the replication.
      enum:
      - Mirror
      - Snapshot
      - Clone
      - TokenizedClone
      type: string
      x-enumDescriptions:
        Clone: Create a point in time, full copy the source.
        Mirror: Create and maintain a copy of the source.
        Snapshot: Create a point in time, virtual copy of the source.
        TokenizedClone: Create a token based clone.
      x-enumLongDescriptions:
        Clone: This enumeration literal shall indicate that replication shall create
          a point in time, full copy the source.
        Mirror: This enumeration literal shall indicate that replication shall create
          and maintain a copy of the source.
        Snapshot: This enumeration literal shall indicate that replication shall create
          a point in time, virtual copy of the source.
        TokenizedClone: This enumeration literal shall indicate that replication shall
          create a token based clone.
      x-longDescription: The enumeration literals may be used to specify the intended
        outcome of the replication.
    StorageReplicaInfo_ReplicaUpdateMode:
      description: Values of ReplicaUpdateMode describe whether the target elements
        will be updated synchronously or asynchronously.
      enum:
      - Active
      - Synchronous
      - Asynchronous
      - Adaptive
      type: string
      x-enumDescriptions:
        Active: Active-Active (i.e. bidirectional) synchronous updates.
        Adaptive: Allows implementation to switch between synchronous and asynchronous
          modes.
        Asynchronous: Asynchronous updates.
        Synchronous: Synchronous updates.
      x-enumLongDescriptions:
        Active: This enumeration literal shall indicate Active-Active (i.e. bidirectional)
          synchronous updates.
        Adaptive: This enumeration literal shall indicate that an implementation may
          switch between synchronous and asynchronous modes.
        Asynchronous: This enumeration literal shall indicate Asynchronous updates.
        Synchronous: This enumeration literal shall indicate Synchronous updates.
      x-longDescription: The enumeration literals may be used to specify whether the
        target elements will be updated synchronously or asynchronously.
    StorageReplicaInfo_StorageReplicaInfo:
      $ref: http://redfish.dmtf.org/schemas/swordfish/v1/StorageReplicaInfo.v1_4_0.yaml#/components/schemas/StorageReplicaInfo_v1_4_0_StorageReplicaInfo
      description: Defines the characteristics of a Storage Replica.
      x-longDescription: This entity shall define the characteristics of a replica.
