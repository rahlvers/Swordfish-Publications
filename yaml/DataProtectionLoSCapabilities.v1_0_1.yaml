          backup media.)
        OnlineActive: Active access to synchronous replicas.
        OnlinePassive: Passive access to replicas via the same front-end interconnect.
      x-enumLongDescriptions:
        Nearline: Access to a replica shall be consistent with switching access to
          a different path through a different front-end interconnection infrastructure.  Some
          inconsistency may occur.  A restore step may be required before recovery
          can commence.
        Offline: Access to a replica may take a significant amount of time.  No direct
          connection to the replica is assumed. Some inconsistency loss may occur.  A
          restore step is likely to be required.
        OnlineActive: Access to synchronous replicas shall be instantaneous.
        OnlinePassive: Access to a synchronous replica shall be consistent with switching
          access to a different path the same front-end interconnect.  A restore step
          shall not be required.
