      description: This is the schema definition for the Capacity of a device. It
        represents the properties for capacity for any data store.
      x-longDescription: This composition may be used to represent storage capacity.  The
        sum of the values in Data, Metadata, and Snapshot shall be equal to the total
        capacity for the data store.

      description: A description of the type and source of storage.
      x-longDescription: This type may be used to represent the source and type of
        storage capacity.  At most one of the ProvidingDrives, ProvidingVolumes or
        ProvidingPools properties may have a value.  If any of ProvidingDrives, ProvidingVolumes
        or ProvidingPools reference more than one resource, allocation of capacity
        across those resources is implementation dependent.
