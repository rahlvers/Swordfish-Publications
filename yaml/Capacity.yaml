      description: A description of the type and source of storage.
      x-longDescription: This type may be used to represent the source and type of
        storage capacity.  At most one of the ProvidingDrives, ProvidingVolumes or
        ProvidingPools properties may have a value.  If any of ProvidingDrives, ProvidingVolumes
        or ProvidingPools reference more than one resource, allocation of capacity
        across those resources is implementation dependent.
