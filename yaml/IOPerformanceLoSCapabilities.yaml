      description: Describe data protection capabilities
      x-longDescription: The capabilities to protect data from loss by the use of
        a replica. The requirements must be met collectively by the communication
        path and the replica. There will be one instance associated to a class of
        service for each replica. Each replica has its own class of service that describes
        its characteristics.
