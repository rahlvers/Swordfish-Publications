The controller shall not set this bit to 1 if the read-only condition on the Endurance Group is a result of a change in the write protection state of all namespaces in the Endurance Group.  2  If set to 1, then the Endurance Group reliability has been degraded due to significant media related errors or any internal error that degrades NVM subsystem reliability.  0 If set to 1, then the available spare capacity of the Endurance Group has fallen below the threshold.",
